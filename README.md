# Online-Code-Compiler

Compiler which let's users run Java, Python, C, C++ code and returns output on Screen
Users don't need to install an IDE to run the code which consumes lots of space for people who just want to tryout new language

Compiler plays an important role in running
programs. It converts source code written in the form of text
into an executable format known as the object code. If
compiler is made to run manually on every system it will
cover a lot of space on the machine and it would also
require proper configuration if it is not installed using
default parameters. In todayâ€™s world most of the
applications and their associated interfaces are made to
work online. So we have created online compiler, The main
objective of such compiler is to facilitate any user such that
programs of any language can be compiled and run without
downloading any IDE (Integrated Development
Environment) or compiler. No development kit is needed on
client machine. This paper aims at describing an online
compiler which helps in promoting platform independency.
Cloud computing usage decreases the problem of storage
space as well as portability. Using different types of
compilers at a single interface enables a programmer to
compile and remove all the bugs in an easy manner and also
help in storing the bugs output conveniently.
